 Signal Processing Projects done on Matlab

### In this repository You can Find some Project with thier description and the code files.

### First Project for Gender Recognition by Voice .
this project aims to build a technique for identification of males and females (maybe further adults and children) from their speech analysis , using MATLAB.

### Second Project for Signal amplitude modulation and demodulation.
 s(t) A normal AM modulation on message m(t) is produced. Then s(t) is demodulated using an envelope detector circuit.
